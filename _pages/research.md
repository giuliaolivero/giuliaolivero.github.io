**Relative wages, gender norms and the child penalty**
> Child penalties account for most of the remaining gender inequality in the labor market. However, very little is known about why child penalties remain so large and gendered. In this work  I investigate the effect of the closing of the gender wage gap on employment penalties for mothers over the years 1980-2010.  To do so, I leverage gender differences in occupational choices and combine gender-specific local labor market shocks with pseudo-event studies around childbirth. I find evidence of a greater fall in child penalties in local labor markets with a faster convergence in the wage rate of women and men, and I explore possible mechanisms.
