I am a PhD candidate in the [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). I am an applied microeconomist with interests in economics of the family, gender economics, and economics of migration. 

My work primarily focuses on how local labor markets and neighborhood characteristics shape economic outcomes for women and undocumented immigrants. 

I work under the supervision of  [Doug Miller](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/douglas-miller/), [Matt Hall](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/matthew-hall/), [Eleonora Patacchini](https://www.epatacchini.com/)  and [Seth Sanders](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/seth-sanders/). 

**I am on the 2024-2025 academic job market.**
