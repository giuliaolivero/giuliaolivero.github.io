I am a PhD candidate in the [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu) at [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu). I am an applied microeconomist with interests in economics of the family, gender economics, and economics of migration. 

My work primarily focuses on how local labor markets and neighborhood characteristics shape economic outcomes for more economically vulnerable populations.

I work under the supervision of  [Doug Miller](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/douglas-miller/), [Matt Hall](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/matthew-hall/), [Eleonora Patacchini](https://www.epatacchini.com/)  and [Seth Sanders](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/people/seth-sanders/). 

In the fall, I will join the [California Center for Population Research](https://ccpr.ucla.edu) at UCLA as a Postdoctoral Scholar, working under the supervision of [Martha Bailey](https://sites.google.com/g.ucla.edu/marthajbailey).
